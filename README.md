## This repository calculates data for labs in my high school chemistry class

> Input your raw data from a lab and it will return calculated values in the form of a well-organized table

So far, this repository calculates data for the following labs:
1. [Preparing and Diluting Solutions](preparing-and-diluting-solutions.html)
2. [Titration of Vinegar](titration-of-vinegar.html)
3. [Measuring Energy Changes](measuring-energy-changes.html)

More calculators are coming soon!
